# Example Dissertation

This repo provides templates for anyone to write a dissertation or thesis using R markdown and knitr. It is a minimal example with dummy code and text to show how all of the elements come together to produce the final document. Here are the [slides from a "lightning talk"](https://github.com/eddiekasner/example-dissertation/blob/master/LightningTalk.Rmd) and a [video recording](https://youtu.be/AP_nU9jd0mk) that walks through the example.
